My thought process behind my game design and branches was that i wanted my players to choose the right thing for the cat he was supposed to take care of. and the game if the player chose the wrong option he would be have an option to go back to where the other option was untill the player chose the correct option. Then in the end the player took care of the cat and when the cat went to sleep that was the end of the game.
