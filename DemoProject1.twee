Momo runs away. I think she wasn't ready for the big beautiful boy to come barreling at her!

Try again by going back to the [[start]].

This game demonstrates how Twine works! 

Everything inside the alligator brackets <> here will only show to the programmer, and NOT to the player.

Notice how there's two options in this passage that the player can choose. Both of these options have double square brackets around the option, which creates a link to the result of choosing that option.

I hope y'all don't mind that I always use my cats as characters in the Minigames. :) Their names are Leo, Willow, Nemo, and Momo.
